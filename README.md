# Map-Locator

PURPOSE: Full stack Project that uses mapbox to represent GEOJSON points on a map.

This a simple GEOJSON map locator that uses mapbox to host a map to display pointed inputted by a user. You can add a point on the map and it will show the name and description in a popup entered optionally by the user. Features within this app are add and delete markers on the map. NOTE: Deleting a point is not entirely correct becasue only the first in the list will get deleted, not a chosen one. I added the feature there for a deletion option but I will update the proper function as soon as I figure it out. I will also be adding in a user account so a user can add their own points for their own account. This I will be implementing as well and it is on the website for display purposes. Registration works with a hashed password but not login. You can find this website on https://agile-sierra-46415.herokuapp.com/
